# Editor
Hoping to get a live SCSS/SASS editor working of BS5 through codepen.io

## Currently works in VSCode with these extensions:

kamikillerto.vscode-colorize
bierner.color-info

ritwickdey.LiveServer
glenn2223.live-sass
mrmlnc.vscode-autoprefixer

pucelle.vscode-css-navigation

## How to set up

I have version 1.71.0 of VScoce installed.
Enable the live previewer.
Enable the above extensions, and turn on the live sass watcher.

Onc eyou edit the Brandy/css.scss file it'll automatically update the preveiwer.

More info to come soon.
