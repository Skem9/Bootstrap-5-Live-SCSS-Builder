# Editor
Hoping to get a live SCSS/SASS editor working of BS5 through codepen.io

## Currently works in VSCode with these extensions:

kamikillerto.vscode-colorize<br>
bierner.color-info<br>
<br>
ritwickdey.LiveServer<br>
glenn2223.live-sass<br>
mrmlnc.vscode-autoprefixer<br>
<br>
pucelle.vscode-css-navigation<br>
Simple Browser<br>

## How to set up

I have version 1.71.0 of VScoce installed.<br>
Enable the live previewer.<br>
Enable the above extensions, and turn on the live sass watcher.<br>

Once you edit the Brandy/css.scss file it'll automatically update the preveiwer.<br>

To have the live previewer update within the editor, press ``F1`` and type in Simple Browser, and start that. Copy / paste the url from the live previewer into the somple browser url bar and you'll have the live previewer update within the editer white you type.

More info to come soon.<br>
